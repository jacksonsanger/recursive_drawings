# Recursive Drawing Project

This project showcases recursion through three Python scripts, each generating unique recursive patterns using the `dudraw` library.

## Features

1. **Fractal Tree**  
   - A pink fractal tree with random variations.  
   - Branches divide recursively, varying in length, thickness, and angle for a natural look.  
   - Implements a recursive method to calculate and draw tree branches, ending in pink blossoms.

2. **Recursive Circles**  
   - A symmetric recursive pattern of circles forming intricate lattice structures.  
   - Each circle spawns smaller circles at its edges, continuing recursively for a specified depth.  
   - Uses simple recursive logic to create a grid-like fractal pattern.

3. **Sierpinski Triangle**  
   - A fractal pattern of nested triangles, also known as the Sierpinski Triangle.  
   - Each level subdivides a triangle into three smaller ones recursively.  

## How to Run
1. Install the required `dudraw` library if not already installed.
2. Run each Python file individually to view the corresponding recursive drawing:
   - `fractal_tree.py` for a random pink fractal tree.
   - `recursive_circles.py` for recursive circle lattices.
   - `sierpinski_triangles.py` for Sierpinski triangles.

## Results
- Each script outputs fractal images:
  - Fractal Tree: Unique on every run.
  - Recursive Circles: Symmetric recursive grids.
  - Sierpinski Triangle: A classic recursive geometric drawing.
